# Pharmacy-manager-JavaFX

This is a Pharmacy manage exercise using Java and Java-FX to be user friendly.

This project envolves layered architecture with four layeres: presentation, in my project named PrimaryController (where I diplay the results), business or service (where I implemented the business logic), persistance or repository (the base layer for data) and the last layes is domaine where I choose to keep all the entities and validation classes.

I also implemented some JUNIT test for CRUD methods and a basic UI with Java-FX.
